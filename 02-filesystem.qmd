In this section you will learn how to explore the Linux file system, and how to create, move, delete and edit files and directories.

### Introducing the Linux file system

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: key-points
<h2><i class="fas fa-thumbtack"></i> Key Points</h2>

-   In Linux, like other operating systems, the file system is structured as a tree
    -   The top-level directory is known as the root directory, and is referred to on the command line as `/`
-   The file system contains regular files, directories, and symbolic links to other files
    -   Each file has a unique path in the file system, along with other attributes such as its size, when it was last modified, and the permissions associated with it
-   Each user's files are generally stored in a directory called the user's *home directory*, also referred to as `~`
    -   Home directories are normally found in `/home`
    -   On the aabn server these are also in `/home1` and `/home2`
-   bash keeps track of the *current working directory* that the shell is in
    -   When a user logs in to a Linux system, it starts in the user's own home directory by default
:::

#### The Linux file system

------------------------------------------------------------------------

![](images/fs.png){width="65%"}

The Linux file system, where all files in a Linux system are stored, is structured as a tree with a single root directory, known as `/`, as shown in the above image. The root directory has a number of sub-directories. The most important for us is `/home` (or `/home1` `/home2`) as this is where users' home directories are stored. Each user's files are generally stored in their home directory, and by default users are not permitted to create files outside their own home directory. You can find out the path to your home directory by running the command `echo $HOME`.

#### File paths in Linux

------------------------------------------------------------------------

File paths in Linux can be either *absolute* paths, or *relative* paths.

##### Absolute paths

Each file in the Linux file system tree is uniquely identified by its absolute path. The absolute path comprises a list of the parent directories of the file, starting from the root directory, separated by the `/` character, followed by the name of the file. The name of a file, and the path to its parent directory, can be extracted from its path using the `basename` and `dirname` commands:

```{bash eval=F}
[USERNAME]@aabn:~$ basename /data/swebb/training/Intro_to_Linux
Intro_to_Linux
[USERNAME]@aabn:~$ dirname /data/swebb/training/Intro_to_Linux
/data/swebb/training
[USERNAME]@aabn:~$ 
```

In Linux, file names can contain almost any character other than `/`. However, many characters, including spaces and special characters such as ' and ", can make files difficult to work with, so, in general, it's better to stick with letters, numbers, underscores, dashes, and dots when naming files. If you do have to work with a file that contains special characters, you can either put the file path in quotes or use backslashes to escape the special characters:

```{bash eval=F}
[USERNAME]@aabn:~$ basename /data/swebb/training/Intro_to_Linux/file name with spaces
basename: extra operand ‘with’
Try 'basename --help' for more information.
[USERNAME]@aabn:~$ basename '/data/swebb/training/Intro_to_Linux/file name with spaces'
file name with spaces
[USERNAME]@aabn:~$ basename /data/swebb/training/file\ name\ with\ spaces
file name with spaces
[USERNAME]@aabn:~$
```

*Note:* Tab completion works with filenames as well as command names.

The `pwd` command shows the absolute path of the current working directory:

```{bash eval=F}
[USERNAME]@aabn:~$ pwd
/home/[USERNAME]
[USERNAME]@aabn:~$
```

##### Relative paths

While absolute paths provide an unambiguous way of referring to files, they can be cumbersome. For this reason, Linux makes it possible to define paths relative to the current working directory or the user's home directory:

-   `~` refers to the user's home directory
-   `.` refers to the current working directory
-   `..` refers to the parent directory of the current working directory
    -   `../..` refers to the parent directory of the parent directory of the current working directory, `../../..` refers to the parent directory of that directory, and so on

If you just use the name of a file, Linux assumes that you are referring to a file in the current working directory.

The `realpath` command can be used to show the absolute path corresponding to a relative path:

```{bash eval=F}
[USERNAME]@aabn:~$ realpath ~
/home/[USERNAME]
[USERNAME]@aabn:~$ realpath .
/home/[USERNAME]
[USERNAME]@aabn:~$ realpath ..
/home
[USERNAME]@aabn:~$ 
```

##### Glob patterns

Linux also makes it possible to include wildcards in file paths, making it possible to refer to a group of file paths at once. Paths that include wildcards are called glob patterns. Useful wildcards include:

-   `*` which matches any sequence of characters
-   `?` which matches any single character
-   `[]` which matches a single character within the square brackets
    -   for example, \[aA\] would match 'a' or 'A'
    -   ranges of numbers are allowed, so \[1-5\] matches 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5

When bash sees a glob pattern, it expands it into a list of file paths that match the pattern (separated by spaces). A convenient way to experiment with glob patterns (and to make sure they match the files you want them to) is to use the `echo` command, which prints its arguments to the command line:

```{bash eval=F}
[USERNAME]@aabn:~$ echo /data/swebb/training/Intro_to_Linux/genomes/*
/data/swebb/training/Intro_to_Linux/genomes/human /data/swebb/training/Intro_to_Linux/genomes/mouse
[USERNAME]@aabn:~$ echo /data/swebb/training/Intro_to_Linux/genomes/mouse/mm?
/data/swebb/training/Intro_to_Linux/genomes/mouse/mm9
[USERNAME]@aabn:~$ echo /data/swebb/training/Intro_to_Linux/genomes/mouse/mm*
/data/swebb/training/Intro_to_Linux/genomes/mouse/mm10 /data/swebb/training/Intro_to_Linux/genomes/mouse/mm9
[USERNAME]@aabn:~$
```

#### File types and attributes in Linux

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Linux file system contains three main types of file:

-   **Regular files**, which contain data
-   **Directories**, which contain other files or directories
-   **Symbolic links**, which are aliases (or pointers) to files and folders

As well as its name and path, each file has a number of attributes associated with it, such as its size, when it was last modified, and the permissions associated with it. You can check the attributes associated with a file using the `stat` command:

```{bash eval=F}
[USERNAME]@aabn:~$ stat /data/swebb/training/Intro_to_Linux/sequences.fa
  File: sequences.fa
  Size: 148       	Blocks: 8          IO Block: 4096   regular file
Device: fc20h/64544d	Inode: 318242838   Links: 1
Access: (0664/-rw-rw-r--)  Uid: (66264/   swebb)   Gid: (66264/   swebb)
Access: 2024-02-05 14:21:24.551796452 +0000
Modify: 2024-02-05 14:21:10.695345100 +0000
Change: 2024-02-05 14:21:20.779673587 +0000
 Birth: -
[USERNAME]@aabn:~$
```

The output of the `stat` command shows us:

-   What type of file this is (a regular file)
-   The size of the file (148)
-   The identity and group of the owner of the file (root)
-   When the file was last accessed, modified, and changed
-   The permissions on the file (-rw-rw--r\--)
    -   The first character of the permission string tells us whether it is a file or directory
    -   The rest of the string can be divided into three groups (rw-, r--, and r--), representing the permissions granted to the user that owns the file, the group associated with the file, and all users
    -   There are three types of permission. These are permission to read the file (`r`), permission to write to the file (`w`), and permission to execute the file (`x`)

<h2><i class="fas fa-thumbtack"></i> Key Points</h2>

-   `cd` changes the current working directory
-   The `ls` command lists the files in the current working directory
-   The `find` command recursively searches for files in the current file system
:::

<br>

The following example demonstrates how we can navigate within the file system, and view and find files:

```{bash eval=F}
[USERNAME]@aabn:~$ cd /data/swebb/training/Intro_to_Linux/ 
[USERNAME]@aabn:/data/swebb/training/Intro_to_Linux/$ ls
analysis_improved.sh   analysis_raw.sh   bioinformatics_on_the_command_line_files.tar.gz  'file name with spaces'   genomes   sequences.fa
[USERNAME]@aabn:/data/swebb/training/Intro_to_Linux/$ ls -lah
total 3.9M
drwxrwxr-x 3 swebb swebb 4.0K Feb  5 14:45  .
drwxrwxr-x 3 swebb swebb 4.0K Feb  5 14:06  ..
-rw-r--r-- 1 swebb swebb 3.2K Feb  5 14:43  analysis_improved.sh
-rw-r--r-- 1 swebb swebb 1.3K Feb  5 14:43  analysis_raw.sh
-rw-r--r-- 1 swebb swebb 3.9M Feb  5 14:44  bioinformatics_on_the_command_line_files.tar.gz
-rw-rw-r-- 1 swebb swebb    0 Feb  5 14:11 'file name with spaces'
drwxrwxr-x 4 swebb swebb 4.0K Feb  5 14:14  genomes
-rw-r--r-- 1 swebb swebb  148 Feb  5 14:21  sequences.fa
[USERNAME]@aabn:/home2/swebb/training/Intro_to_Linux/$ ls -lah *.gz
-rw-r--r-- 1 swebb swebb 3.9M Feb  5 14:44 bioinformatics_on_the_command_line_files.tar.gz
[USERNAME]@aabn:/data/swebb/training/Intro_to_Linux/$ find genomes/mouse/mm10/ -type f -name '*.bed'
genomes/mouse/mm10/cpg_islands.bed
genomes/mouse/mm10/genes.bed
genomes/mouse/mm10/repeats.bed
[USERNAME]@aabn:/data/swebb/training/Intro_to_Linux/$ cd
[USERNAME]@aabn:~$ 

```

*Note:* In this example we have used the command `ls -lah`. This is an example of a shorthand that you can use in the bash shell when specifying multiple flags. `ls -lah` is equivalent to `ls -l -a -h`.

### Creating and deleting files

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: key-points
<h2><i class="fas fa-thumbtack"></i> Key Points</h2>

-   Files can be created using `touch`, by a text editor, or by redirecting the output of a program
-   Symbolic links can be created using `ln -s`
-   Directories can be created using `mkdir`, and empty directories can be removed using `rmdir`
-   The `rm` command can be used to delete files, links, and directories along with their contents (using the `-r` flag)
    -   There is no recycle bin in Linux, so `rm` should be used with care. The `-i` flag can be used to prompt for confirmation before deleting files
:::

<br>

The following example demonstrates how we can create and remove files, directories and links:

```{bash eval=F}
[USERNAME]@aabn:~$ cd
[USERNAME]@aabn:~$ mkdir course
[USERNAME]@aabn:~$ cd course
[USERNAME]@aabn:~/course$ mkdir -p dir1 dir2 dir3/dir4
[USERNAME]@aabn:~/course$ tree
.
├── dir1
├── dir2
└── dir3
    └── dir4
    
4 directories, 0 files
[USERNAME]@aabn:~/course$ touch file1
[USERNAME]@aabn:~/course$ tree
.
├── dir1
├── dir2
├── dir3
│   └── dir4
└── file1

4 directories, 1 file
[USERNAME]@aabn:~/course$ cd dir1
[USERNAME]@aabn:~/course$ ln -s ../file1
[USERNAME]@aabn:~/course$ cd ..
[USERNAME]@aabn:~/course$ tree
.
├── dir1
│   └── file1 -> ../file1
├── dir2
├── dir3
│   └── dir4
└── file1

4 directories, 2 files
[USERNAME]@aabn:~/course$ rmdir *
rmdir: failed to remove 'dir1': Directory not empty
rmdir: failed to remove 'dir3': Directory not empty
rmdir: failed to remove 'file1': Not a directory
[USERNAME]@aabn:~/course$ tree
.
├── dir1
│   └── file1 -> ../file1
├── dir3
│   └── dir4
└── file1

3 directories, 2 files
[USERNAME]@aabn:~/course$ rm -ri *
rm: descend into directory 'dir1'? y
rm: remove symbolic link 'dir1/file1'? y
rm: remove directory 'dir1'? n
rm: descend into directory 'dir3'? y
rm: remove directory 'dir3/dir4'? y
rm: remove directory 'dir3'? y
rm: remove regular empty file 'file1'? n
[USERNAME]@aabn:~/course$ tree
.
├── dir1
└── file1

1 directory, 1 file
[USERNAME]@aabn:~/course$ rmdir dir1
[USERNAME]@aabn:~/course$ rm -i file1
rm: remove regular empty file 'file1'? y
[USERNAME]@aabn:~/course$ tree
.

0 directories, 0 files
[USERNAME]@aabn:~/course$
```

The example demonstrates a number of commands:

-   `touch` to create an empty file
    -   This can also be used to update the timestamp on an existing file
-   `mkdir` to create empty directories
    -   Add -p to create nested directories by specifying paths
-   `ln -s` to create a symbolic link to a file or directory
-   `rmdir` to delete empty directories, without deleting files or non-empty directories
-   `rm` command
    -   Add -r to remove directories (and their contents)
    -   Add -i to ask for confirmation before deleting

### Copying and moving files and directories

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: key-points
<h2><i class="fas fa-thumbtack"></i> Key Points</h2>

-   Files and directories can be copied using `cp`
    -   To copy a directory along with its contents, use the `-r` flag
-   Archive files in *tar* format can be extracted using the `tar` command
-   Directories can be synchronised using `rsync`, which only copies updated files
-   Files and directories can be moved or renamed using `mv`
-   Attributes of files and directories can be changed using `chmod`
    -   `chmod` changes the permissions on a file
:::

<br>

The following example demonstrates how we can copy files and directories, extract archive files and update file permissions:

```{bash eval=F}
[USERNAME]@aabn:~/course$ cp /data/swebb/training/Intro_to_Linux/bioinformatics_on_the_command_line_files.tar.gz .

rm: remove write-protected regular file 'bioinformatics_on_the_command_line_files/raw_yeast_rnaseq_data.fastq'? n
[USERNAME]@aabn:~/course$
```

This example has demonstrated a number of commands:

-   `cp` to copy files and directories (with the `-r` flag set)
    -   The `-a` flag will preserve file attributes when they are copied
-   `mv` to move files or directories
-   `chmod` to change the permissions on a file
    -   It's always a good idea to make raw data files read only as we did in the example, as it makes it more difficult to remove or overwrite them accidentally
    -   the `a-w` argument removes `w`rite access for `a`ll users.
    -   Check the `chmod` man page for more details on how to change file permissions. For now it is fine to just know this is possible.
